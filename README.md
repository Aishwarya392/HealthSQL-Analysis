"# 🚀 Medical Data Analysis - SQL Project Overview 🏥

I'm excited to present my latest SQL project focused on analyzing medical data. This project showcases the power of SQL to derive valuable insights from large datasets. Below is a snapshot of the key components of the project:

## 📊 Core Queries and Outcomes

1️⃣ **Gender-Specific Patient Data**:  
   Retrieved and highlighted the first name, last name, and gender of male patients. This essential query lays the groundwork for further in-depth analyses.

2️⃣ **Patients Without Allergies**:  
   Analyzed patient data to identify individuals without any recorded allergies by listing their first and last names. This is a significant factor for healthcare decision-making.

3️⃣ **Patients with 'C' Starting Names**:  
   Focused on demographics by filtering and listing the first names of patients whose names begin with the letter 'C'. A straightforward yet useful query for targeted analysis.

4️⃣ **Weight-Based Patient Segmentation**:  
   Assessed the weight distribution by selecting patients whose weights fall within a specified range (100 to 120). This provides insight into patient health trends.

5️⃣ **Allergy Data Standardization**:  
   Improved data integrity by updating the 'patients' table, replacing NULL entries in the 'allergies' column with 'NKA' (No Known Allergies). This step ensures more reliable data for analysis.

...and many more queries were executed to reveal additional insights and trends within the dataset!

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

🔄 **Mastering Data Handling**:  
   Gained experience in record updates, managing NULL values, and maintaining consistent data quality.

🤝 **Advanced Table Joins and Data Relationships**:  
   Refined my skills in joining tables to discover meaningful relationships within the data, a vital technique for comprehensive data analysis.

📈 **Handling Complex Data Aggregations**:  
   Addressed complex aggregations, such as calculating total patient heights and pinpointing patients with multiple admissions for the same condition.
